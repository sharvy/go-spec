# Plan 02-02: Update /gs:help Session Management Table

**Phase:** 02-cancel-command
**Wave:** 1
**Depends on:** none

## Goal

Add a single row for `/gs:cancel` to the "Session Management" table in
`commands/gs/help.md`. This makes the new command visible to users who run /gs:help and
keeps the reference complete. No other sections need to change.

## Pre-conditions

- `commands/gs/help.md` exists and is unchanged from the version read during planning
- The "Session Management" table currently has exactly two rows: `/gs:resume` and `/gs:pause`
- `commands/gs/cancel.md` need not exist yet — this plan is Wave 1 and runs in parallel with 02-01

## Tasks

### Task 1: Add /gs:cancel row to the Session Management table

**Action:** Update

**File:** `/Users/sharvyahmed/open-source/go-spec/commands/gs/help.md`

**Details:**

Locate the "Session Management" table. It currently reads (lines 69–74):

```
### Session Management
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/gs:resume` | Resume from previous session |
| `/gs:pause` | Create handoff and stop cleanly |
```

Add one row for `/gs:cancel` immediately after the `/gs:pause` row. The table must read:

```
### Session Management
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/gs:resume` | Resume from previous session |
| `/gs:pause` | Create handoff and stop cleanly |
| `/gs:cancel` | Abort an in-progress /gs:init and remove partial artifacts |
```

No other lines in the file change. The new row is appended as the last row in the table,
after `/gs:pause` and before the blank line that separates this table from the next section
(`### Phase Management`).

**Done when:** `commands/gs/help.md` contains the line
`| \`/gs:cancel\` | Abort an in-progress /gs:init and remove partial artifacts |`
as the last row of the Session Management table, and all other lines in the file are
byte-for-byte identical to the original.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] `commands/gs/help.md` contains the new `/gs:cancel` row in the Session Management table
- [ ] The row text is exactly: `| \`/gs:cancel\` | Abort an in-progress /gs:init and remove partial artifacts |`
- [ ] The row appears after `/gs:pause` and before the blank line that precedes `### Phase Management`
- [ ] No other content in `help.md` has changed
- [ ] The file still renders as valid markdown (table columns are pipe-aligned consistently with existing rows)

## Deviation Policy

**Auto-fix (no need to stop):**
- Minor whitespace adjustment to keep table columns visually aligned, as long as the rendered content is identical

**Stop and report:**
- The Session Management table structure in the current file differs from what is described above (e.g., different row order, additional rows already present) — stop and report before editing
- Any ambiguity about where to insert the row relative to existing table rows

## Notes for Executor

Read the file before editing to confirm the current content matches the "before" state
described above. The exact line numbers in the file at the time of execution may differ
from those observed during planning if other edits have been made, so match by content,
not by line number.

The description text for the new row — "Abort an in-progress /gs:init and remove partial
artifacts" — comes directly from 02-RESEARCH.md ("help.md integration" section) and must
be used verbatim.
