# Summary: Plan 02-02

**Status:** COMPLETE

## Tasks Completed
- Task 1: Added `/gs:cancel` row to the Session Management table in `commands/gs/help.md` — row inserted after `/gs:pause` and before the blank line preceding `### Phase Management`, with exact text: `| \`/gs:cancel\` | Abort an in-progress /gs:init and remove partial artifacts |`

## Deviations
None

## Notes
Pre-conditions were verified before editing: the Session Management table had exactly two rows (`/gs:resume` and `/gs:pause`) and the file structure matched the plan description exactly. The single-line addition is byte-for-byte correct and the file renders as valid markdown with consistent pipe alignment.
