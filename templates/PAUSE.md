## What Was Being Worked On

Task [NNN] — [task description]
Branch: [branch name]

## What's Done

- [Completed task or step — one line each]
- [Previous completed step]

## What's In Progress

[Exact state of the in-progress work. Be specific:
"Task 2 of 4 — avatar upload to S3. Presigned URL logic written in
src/services/upload.ts. Tests not written yet. S3 call works in isolation
but not wired to the profile endpoint."]

## What's Next

[The single most important next action:]
[Example: "Write tests for the upload service (Task 2), then wire it to PATCH
/api/users/:id/avatar (Task 3). See PLAN.md for full task details."]

## Blockers

[Anything that needs to be resolved before work can continue]
[Example: "Need S3_BUCKET_NAME env var for staging — ask @devops"]
[Or: None]

## Notes

[Anything that would be lost without writing it down:
 - Design decision made mid-session and why
 - Something that looks wrong but is intentional
 - Bug spotted but not yet fixed
 - Question to answer before continuing
 - Anything a fresh reader would find confusing]
