# Project State

<!-- Shared team memory. Update when starting a task, completing work, making a decision,
     or hitting a blocker. Commit to git so teammates always have the latest. -->

## Active Work

<!-- One row per in-progress task. Update when you start or finish something. -->

| Task # | Description | Developer | Branch | Status |
|--------|-------------|-----------|--------|--------|
| — | — | — | — | — |

## Recently Completed

<!-- Last 5–10 completed tasks. Oldest drop off when list gets long. -->

| Task # | Description | Developer | Date |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------|

## Established Decisions

<!-- Key decisions all developers and AI agents must follow.
     Update when the team agrees on a new pattern or convention. -->

### Tech Stack
- **Language:** [e.g., TypeScript 5.x]
- **Runtime:** [e.g., Node.js 20]
- **Framework:** [e.g., Express / Next.js / FastAPI]
- **Database:** [e.g., PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM]
- **Auth:** [e.g., JWT with refresh tokens]
- **Testing:** [e.g., Vitest, Jest, RSpec]

### Patterns
- [e.g., "API routes live in src/routes/, one file per domain"]
- [e.g., "Error responses always include `code` and `message` fields"]
- [e.g., "All async functions must handle errors — no unhandled rejections"]

### Key Conventions
- [e.g., "Tests live in `__tests__/` next to the file they test"]
- [e.g., "Environment variables accessed only through `src/config.ts`"]
- [e.g., "kebab-case for filenames, camelCase for variables"]

## Open Blockers

<!-- Anything preventing progress. Remove when resolved. -->

- [None]
